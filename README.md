# Project: Registration Form Front-End Completion

## Introduction

This project aims to complete the front-end development of a registration form for a contest website. The initial structure and styling were created by Jason, but he couldn't finish the JavaScript functionality before leaving for a new position. My task was to pick up where Jason left off and complete the necessary JavaScript to make the form fully functional.
